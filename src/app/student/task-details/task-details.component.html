            <h2>Dijkstra's algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph,
                which may represent, for example, road networks.For a given source node in the graph, the 
                algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.[3]:196â€“206 It can also 
                be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by 
                stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.
